# The Actual Module
# Location	./correct_python_structure/ or ./correct_python_structure.py
# Purpose	The code of interest
# Your module package is the core focus of the repository. It should not be tucked away:

# ./correct_python_structure/

# If your module consists of only a single file, you can place it directly in the root of your repository:

# ./correct_python_structure.py

 # Your library does not belong in an ambiguous src or python subdirectory.
